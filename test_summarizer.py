SpaceX successfully launched its massive Starship rocket into orbit on Thursday morning from its Texas facility. 
The uncrewed test flight achieved several major milestones, including successful stage separation and reaching space. 
However, the company lost contact with the spacecraft during its reentry into Earth's atmosphere over the Indian Ocean.
Despite the loss of the ship, SpaceX engineers cheered the mission as a massive success for the future of space exploration.
